**REFRENCE OPERATOR**
& is refrence operator. It doesn't assign value to variable . It assign the refrence(memory location) that mean whenever you change value of that memory location(first variable) , the second varibale auto update!.
```php
$x = 2;
$y = &$x;
$x = 3;
echo $y; //3
```

**Double Quote vs Single Qoute**
Double Quote("") can handle variable, variable auto show its value. But it not work in Single Qoute('')

**Comments**
```php
// and # can be used for single line 
/* */ for multi line
/**
* for documentation
*/
```

!comment are stop at php closing tag

**Constant in PHP**
constant can't be reassigned!
constant should be in capital letter and case sensitive,
you can control the case sensitive , but you shouldn't do it.
```php
define("APP_NAME","markdown app");
const PORT = 8000;
# constant with const are created at compile time and constant with define() are created at runtime.
# So you can't use const within control structure like loop and if statement. but define() can.
```
**Dynamic Constant**
```php
$type = "PAID";
define("STATUS_" . $type , 4); //$type make PAID for constant
echo STATUS_PAID; // 4
```
**variable variables **
it is a way to define a variable using another variable. help you to create dynamic variable.
```php
$v1 = "helo";
$$v1 = "helo2"; // $helo 
echo $$v1 , $helo , $v1 ; // helo2 , helo2 , helo
# $$v1 is not work at plain " " but work with {}**
echo "{$$v1} , $$v1 , ${$v1} " ; // helo2 , $helo , helo2
```

**You can check type with**
```php
gettype();
var_dump();
```
**Type Juggling / Type coercion**
```php
sum(int $x , int $y){
    var_dump($x , $y) // int(1) , int(2) auto overwrite type to integer
    return $x + $y;
}
sum(1,"2"); //3
// but you can reoverwrite after type juggling like this 
//  sum(int $x , int $y){ 
//     $x= 5.5 ;
//  return $x + $y } // 7.5 not switch to int , it change to float
```
But you can use the strict type mode not to happen that
```php
declare(strict_types=1) ;
sum(int $x , int $y){
    var_dump($x , $y) // int(1) , int(2) auto overwrite type to integer
    return $x + $y;
}
sum(1,"2"); // it will show error at you IDE 
// But strict mode also allow type piroty , it like integer can pass to float type ðŸ¥¹
```
**Type Casting**
switch type 
```php
$x = (int)"5"; 
var_dump($x) ; // int(5)
```
